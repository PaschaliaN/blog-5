<h1>Prana Breathes with You</h1>
<p>
Prana was a light installation piece that was created by B-reel Media in 2015. B reel Media is a film and interactive media company that worked solely in creative branding before starting the Prana Project.

Prana is a lights installation peace hung from the ceiling; users get into the  installation and breath a couple of times, then radar sensors to track and pick your breathing patterns and sends signals to the light to respond by mimicking your breathing rhythm. The piece is built with node.js and python, and it is an open source code.  It allows people to contribute to the code and contribute to the light animation patterns on Prana's website. B-reel invite people to produce and create their light show and experience it while visiting the installation.

I love this peace; it would be extremely calming and fascinating to experience Prana, it reminded me of Yoga and meditation. <br>
